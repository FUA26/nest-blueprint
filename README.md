# NestJS REST API ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© by FUA

## Description

is a robust foundation for building modern backend applications following a Node.js-based architecture. Nest.js is a TypeScript-based framework that simplifies application development by providing an organized and clean structure.

This blueprint provides a ready-to-use and well-designed framework to facilitate the development of resilient and scalable REST APIs. By utilizing this blueprint, developers can focus on their core business logic without spending excessive time on setting up the project's basic structure.
